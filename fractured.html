        <div class="bg-text">
            <p>"Fractured" is a 2019 psychological thriller directed by Brad Anderson and starring Sam Worthington, Lily Rabe, and Stephen Tobolowsky. The movie follows a man named Ray Monroe (Worthington) as he desperately searches for his wife and daughter who disappeared in a hospital after an accident. As he tries to uncover the truth, he begins to doubt his own sanity and reality itself.
                The movie starts strong with an intriguing premise and sets up a tense atmosphere right from the start. However, as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that the plot is predictable and lacks originality. The twists and turns are telegraphed early on, and the ending is unsatisfying and underwhelming.
                Despite this, the performances in the movie are solid, with Sam Worthington delivering a convincing portrayal of a man who is struggling with his own sanity. Lily Rabe is also excellent as Ray's wife, and her chemistry with Worthington adds to the emotional weight of the movie.
                The movie's cinematography is also impressive, with the use of dark and moody lighting adding to the overall sense of unease. The hospital setting is also effectively used, with the sterile environment adding to the feeling of isolation and desperation.
                However, "Fractured" ultimately falls short due to its lackluster plot and predictable twists. While it starts strong, it fails to deliver on its promise and ends up feeling like a missed opportunity. It's a movie that is worth watching for its performances and atmosphere, but don't expect to be blown away by the story.
