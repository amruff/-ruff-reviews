            <p>"Hereditary" is a haunting and unsettling horror movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Directed by Ari Aster, the film tells the story of a family who begins to unravel after the death of their grandmother. The film features powerful performances from its cast, including Toni Collette, who gives a standout performance as Annie Graham, the matriarch of the family.
                The movie begins with the death of Annie's mother, and the family's subsequent attempts to cope with their loss. However, strange and disturbing events begin to unfold, as the family is haunted by an unseen force that seems to be driving them to the brink of insanity. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the family is caught in a web of supernatural forces, and that their fate is tied to a dark and terrifying history that they never could have imagined.
                The movie is beautifully shot, with a haunting score that perfectly captures the film's dark and brooding atmosphere. The pacing is deliberate and slow, building tension and suspense until the film's shocking conclusion. The film's themes of grief, family dysfunction, and the legacy of trauma are explored in a visceral and emotionally resonant way.
                While "Hereditary" is not for the faint of heart, it is a masterful work of horror that will stay with you long after the credits roll. If you are a fan of horror movies that are more interested in psychological terror than jump scares, then "Hereditary" is a must-see.
